After some research it seems that the artwork is proprietary so
my plan is to replace all the proprietary artwork with open source
stuff.

First I'll go through the code and see what is actually being used and 
then I'll remove what isn't being used.

When I've broken it down to the basic sprites and sounds, I'll 
begin to replace them keeping the positions the same on the sprite sheets.


Sprites
-------
I really couldn't find artwork that I could pop in so I decided
to draw everything. I pretty much made it all with mtPaint and
kolour paint. I made sure to credit anything I didn't create.
